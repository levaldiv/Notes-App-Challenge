# Responsive VUE Notes App Challenge

How's it going everyone! This here is a Responsive VUE Notes App Challenge! I was tasked to create a notes app using the VUE.js framework. This was definitely a challeging YET exciting build as I learned VUE.js.

**NOTE:** You can create throwaway accounts.


## Core Features

- Built using VUE.js, Nhost.io, GraphQL, JS
- Implemented a login authentication flow using Nhost's database
- Created a GraphQL backend that directly connects to my PostgreSQL Nhost database
- Created GraphQL queries and mutations to retrieve, create, and delete notes
- With all that .. I hope you enjoy!
